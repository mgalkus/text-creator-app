A project showcasing functionality of an AI Text Generator (I build a similar one for [zyro.com](https://www.zyro.com)).
The project imitates text creation (dummy texts are provided), as I coulnd't use the API.

What I really enjoyed with this task was manipulating the DOM!

[Live Version is hosted here](https://textcreator.netlify.com/).

### Features
- Text input valitation
- Text count
- Possibility to copy generated text
- Modal window to generate text again
- Responsive
- Js code contains more comments on functionality and code decisions

### Down sides
It was agreed the original project wouldn't use BEM and there was no focus on accessibility. I have'nt corrected these downside yet in this project either.
